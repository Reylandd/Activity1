            <h1>Republic Act 10630</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Juvenile delinquency is the term used to describe the involvement 
                of children or adolescents in illegal or antisocial activities. 
                Juvenile delinquents are also known as children in conflict with 
                the law, or CICL. Some of the possible causes and risk factors of 
                juvenile delinquency include poverty, abuse, trauma, peer pressure, 
                family problems, substance abuse, mental health issues, and lack of 
                education. Some of the possible effects and consequences of juvenile 
                delinquency include criminal records, incarceration, social stigma, 
                low self-esteem, poor academic performance, and reduced employment opportunities.<br>

                Republic Act No. 9344 or the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 
                is a law that establishes a comprehensive juvenile justice and welfare 
                system in the Philippines. It aims to protect the rights and welfare of 
                children in conflict with the law, and to provide them with appropriate 
                intervention and support programs.
