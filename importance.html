            <h1>Importance</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The importance of this law is that it recognizes 
                the potential for positive change in young offenders 
                and seeks to transform them into responsible and 
                productive members of society. It also adheres to 
                the international standards of child protection, 
                especially those to which the Philippines is a party. 
                It promotes the best interests of the child, the 
                participation of the child, and the respect for the dignity 
                and worth of the child. It also adopts measures for dealing 
                with children without resorting to judicial proceedings, 
                whenever appropriate and desirable. It provides a variety
                 of disposition measures that are child-appropriate, such 
                 as care, guidance, supervision, counseling, probation, 
                 foster care, education and vocational training programs and 
                 other alternatives to institutional care.</p>
